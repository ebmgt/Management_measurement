Does this plot show that ESG reporting, or internal reporting if accompanied by focused departmental and management support, can identify healthcare institutions with successful workforce environments?

At the bottom of this page is a plot of [Glassdoor rankings](https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm) by employees of:
* Two large companies, ${\color{#34a853}Google}$ and ${\color{#02a4ef}Microsoft}$, that serially measure well-being and use the results.
* The few healthcare organizations that achieved successive years in the Glassdoor top 50. The ${\color{#0151fe}Mayo \space Clinic}$  story is instructive and available details are below.

The plots suggest that:
* Several years are needed between large organizational changes, such as the launch of ${\color{#34a853}Googlegeist}$ surveys at Google and the arrival of ${\color{#02a4ef}Satya \space Nadella}$ at Microsoft, before large changes in employee reaction. The Google story was been detailed ([Bock, 2015](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=1-4447-9238-5); [Garvin, 2012](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=44657)). The Microsoft story is complicated as they have had a People Analytics team since the early 2000s ([reference](https://www.myhrfuture.com/digital-hr-leaders-podcast/2019/11/19/the-evolution-of-people-analytics-at-microsoft])) but starting approximately 2002 ([reference](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer)) their focus included the toxic [Stack Ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve) of employees. Microsoft started their focus on well-being sometime between Ballmer's leaving in 2014 and 2020 when Microsoft first publicly released results. Then in 2022, Microsoft added the measurement of thriving to their existing measurement of engagement. Microsoft based this goal on the work of [Spreitzer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CUMVmQgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who defined thriving as "a sense of vitality and learning" ([reference](https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fjob.756)) while Microsoft modified the definition to “be energized and empowered to do meaningful work” ([reference](https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-microsoft-measures-employee-thriving-not-engagement))
* The gains require sustained work and high level support. This is shown in the fall of the Mayo Clinic data with the departure of relevant leaders.
* Measurement-guided interventions on workforce well-being are likely very important but we do not know if they are required as we do not know that *all* high ranking companies use this strategy. They may not a panacea as suggested by Google's recent falling in rankings despite presumed continuing use of measurement-guided interventions. However, Google is still ranked higher than all large health care organizations monitored by Glassdoor.

### The Mayo Clinic measurement-guided interventions in a large clinical setting, 2014 and 2015 to 2020

#### 1. Serial measurement of assessments by the frontline of the organization and management 
Like Google and Microsoft, required a similar number of years after introducing major organizational change before positive impact on Glassdoor rankings occurred.
> We began systematically measuring burnout using standardized instruments in 2010...As part of its efforts to foster a cohesive organization, Mayo Clinic surveys its physicians, scientists, allied health staff, and all other employees approximately every 24 months. This _all-staff_ survey is administered by an independent consulting organization...Historically, we assessed these dimensions every 24 months, but we switched to _annual_ assessment in 2016 ([Shanafelt & Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627)). 

In 2014, the Mayo Clinic entered the Glassdoor top 50 ranking (see chart below). The burnout rate among physicians in the Mayo Clinic for 2016 was 33% by Maslach Burnout Inventory (high EE or high DP subscale) (Shanafelt. Mayo Clin Proc. 2017 PMID: [27871627](HTTP://pubmed.gov/27871627)). At that time the national rate for physician burnout was 44% and the rate for the general public was 28%  (Shanafelt. Mayo Clin Proc. 2019 PMID: [30803733](HTTP://pubmed.gov/30803733)) The Mayo was also in the top 50 for the years 2017 (44) and 2020 (28) but these are not plotted as they are isolated years. 

#### 2. Hotspotting to identify and help less effective managers within a large healthcare system
> Although anonymous at the level of the individual, results are aggregated at the work unit level (eg, division/department) to allow executive leadership to focus attention and resources where they are most needed ([Shanafelt & Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627)). 

> Among the 7 Mayo Clinic work units with analyzable data [with burnout rates higher than the national average and satisfaction below the 50th percentile relative to other US organizations] that went through this process after the 2013 survey...6 of these 7 work units no longer met the criteria initially used to identify high-opportunity work units. 
 ([Shanafelt & Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627))

#### 3. Brightspotting to identify tactics of successful departments
> "...we doubled down on lessons from departments that had done well with leadership development so we could make that an institutional model."
([Swensen, 2020](https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RLI/Podcasts/Episode-25-Swensen-Final-Transcript.pdf))

#### 4. Senior leadership's role
> “Fundamentally, you manage what you measure,” argues Mayo Clinic President and Chief Executive Officer John Noseworthy. “CEO performance scorecards always include financial and quality measures, but mine also has staff engagement, satisfaction, and burnout measures that are reported up to the board of trustees.”
([Wright & Katz, 2018](https://pubmed.gov/29365301))

Noseworthy retired in 2018, Shanafelt left the Mayo Clinic in 2017, and Swensen became Professor Emeritus in 2018. <!-- https://moln.org/news/431461/Nurses-as-Leaders-Broad-Acceptance-Room-to-Grow.htm -->

### St Jude data interventions in a smaller clinical setting, 2018 to present
St Jude is a much smaller clinical site than the Mayo Clinic and has less than 80 beds ([source](https://www.stjude.org/about-st-jude/unique-operating-model.html#:~:text=As%20one%20of%20the%20largest,since%20we%20opened%20the%20hospital)).
<!--
Probably not influencing rates of burnout at St Jude because of lack of temporal association, St Jude started using the AHRQ SOPS Hospital Survey in 2009 and biennially since ([AHRQ reports](https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/case-studies/cquips1402.html); [St Jude website](https://www.stjude.org/treatment/services/clinics-and-services/patient-safety.html)). In 2017 the [AHRQ reported](https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/case-studies/201709.html) that St Jude used AHRQ SOPS Hospital Survey to gather workforce feedback to change workflows to improve patient safety.

St Jude began participation in the annual [survey of Great Places to work](https://fortune.com/franchise-list-page/best-companies-2024-methodology/) in approximately 2010 ([source](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2019-medicine-science-news/st-jude-named-to-fortune-magazines-100-best-companies-to-work-for-for-ninth-consecutive-year.html)). The survey methods are overviewed at https://www.greatplacetowork.com/solutions/employee-surveys. 
-->
Also relevant to the [job demands-resources model of burnout](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/job.248]), in 2015 St Jude started expanding the workforce size ([St Jude link](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2019-medicine-science-news/st-jude-named-to-fortune-magazines-100-best-companies-to-work-for-for-ninth-consecutive-year.html)).

In 2018, St Jude entered the Glassdoor top 50 ranking (see chart below) and Downing was rated as the #5 CEO by Glassdoor ([Glassdoor link](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/top-ceos-2018/))

Accordingly, two publications of burnout rates in St Jude reported low rates in 2018:
* 28% by Maslach Burnout Inventory (high EE or high DP subscale) of 53 attending physicians in 2018 (Blazin et al. JCO Oncol Pract. 2021 PMID: [33720755](HTTP://pubmed.gov/33720755)).
* 34% by Maslach Burnout Inventory (high EE or high DP or high PA subscale) in 2018 among 65 physicians.  20% to 33% among other clinical staff groups (Dunn et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 PMID: [34227729](HTTP://pubmed.gov/34227729))

In 2019, the burnout rate rose and in 2019, the Glassdoor ranking for St Jude fell although still in the top 50:
* 43% by the SIBOQ embedded in a Mini-Z survey of physicians. This equals an MBI rate of about 50% ([conversion details](https://ebmgt.github.io/well-being_measurement/)). (Raney et alL. JCO Oncol Pract. 2020 PMID: [32758084](HTTP://pubmed.gov/32758084)).

#### Soliciting, prioritizing, and responses to issues submitted by employees within a small, single hospital
In 2015, the [2016-2021 strategic](https://www.stjude.org/content/dam/en_US/shared/www/about-st-jude/st-jude-strategic-plan-2015-external.pdf) plan noted a new process to gather and prioritize issues of employees:
> The CEO will initiate monthly town hall meetings to solicit input on key institutional efforts and issues. This new program will incorporate a page on the St. Jude intranet for employees to submit questions, rank the priority of the questions and see what questions will be discussed at upcoming town hall meetings.

#### Senior leadership's role
St Jude appointed a new CEO, James Downing, in 2014, a few years before their rise the Glassdoor rankings. According to a St Jude [news release](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2018-medicine-science-news/st-jude-ceo-james-downing-ranked-no-5-of-glassdoors-top-100-ceos.html) noted
> "Under Downing’s leadership, St. Jude has increased employee feedback channels and forums, resulting in more innovation and connectivity across the Memphis-based campus. Downing leads monthly Town Hall and Blueprint Series all-employee meeting opportunities that encourage employees to share ideas and connect with leadership."

### Sloan-Kettering 2014-2019
Sloan-Kettering had successive years in the Glassdoor top 50 ranking peaking at 20 in 2016. It is unclear what may have caused this during those years.

### Houston Methodist 2021 - present
Houston Methodist has successive years in the Glassdoor top 50 ranking peaking at 33 in 2023. It is unclear what may have caused this during those years.
